<p>
    To represent the biomass hierarchy, we use the skos relations (<b>skos:narrower</b> and <b>skos:broader</b>). <br />  To specify that one concept has a more generic meaning than another, we use the <b>skos:broader</b> relation.
    For example, to represent that biom:WoodyBiomass is more generic than biom:PlantationandForest we define the <b>skos:broader </b>relation as : <b>biom:PlantationandForest skos:broader biom:WoodyBiomass.</b> <br />
    To specify that one concept has a more specific meaning than another, <b> skos:narrower</b> is used. <br />
    The figure does not contain these relationships for reasons of clarity.
    Figure 2 shows an example of the use of these relationships.
    The biomass information represented in the example is as follows:

    <strong>
        Biomass Name:
    </strong> Briquettes
    
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
